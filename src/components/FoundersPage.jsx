                  WeHear began when Kanishka Patel, during his final year of
                  engineering, discovered the use of bone conduction technology in
                  military helmets. Intrigued, he teamed up with Raj Shah to explore
                  its potential in hearing solutions. The result was <i>HearNU</i>, 
                  India's first non-surgical bone conduction hearing aid.
